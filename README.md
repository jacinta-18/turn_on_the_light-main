# Assignment Instruction!!!
*The aim of this assignment is to help you practice the basic you've learned so far in Javascript. Instead of the `inline` Javascript added to the two buttons, you are to convert the event to internal Javascript.*

*Use the Javascript document model to target the two buttons and make them turn on and turn of the bulb when clicked.*

1. Create intern script tag `<script type="text/javascript"></script>`
2. Give button 1 `id` of `myBtn1`
3. Use JavaScript `document` to target `myBtn1` id and store in a const variable called `btn1`
4. Give the second button id of `myBtn2`
5. Use JavaScript `document` to target `myBtn2` id and store in a const variable called `btn2`
6. Add event listener to each of the buttons and replace the image `src` attribute.
7. Make sure you remove the `onclick` attribute in the two button tags.
